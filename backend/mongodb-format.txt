## MongoDB Connection URI Format Guide

The MongoDB connection URI should follow this format:

```
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.<random-id>.mongodb.net/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Example:
```
mongodb+srv://john_doe:mySecurePassword123@cluster0.abc123.mongodb.net/faux-orator?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### Parts to replace:
1. `<username>` - Your MongoDB Atlas database user (not your Atlas account email)
2. `<password>` - The password for your database user
3. `<cluster-name>` - Usually "cluster0" for your first cluster
4. `<random-id>` - A unique identifier for your cluster (e.g., "abc123")
5. `<database-name>` - Your database name (e.g., "faux-orator")

### Where to find your URI:
1. Log in to MongoDB Atlas
2. Click on "Connect" for your cluster
3. Choose "Connect your application"
4. Select "Node.js" as the driver
5. Copy the connection string

### Common errors:
- `ENOTFOUND` - Usually means the hostname is incorrect
- Authentication failed - Check username and password
- Network access error - Ensure your IP is allowed in Network Access settings

### Security tips:
- Never commit your actual connection URI to version control
- Use environment variables (.env file) to store the URI
- Create a dedicated database user with appropriate permissions
- Restrict network access to trusted IP addresses
