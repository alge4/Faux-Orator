# Agentic Network Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Agentic Network Structure for the Faux-Orator system. The core architecture follows a central orchestration model where the DM's Assistant coordinates with specialized agents.

## Database Schema Implementations

### Voice System

- Added embedded `voice_profile` to NPCs for unified voice settings
- Created `voice_cache` table for TTS caching with expiration support
- Added resource controls to campaigns for voice concurrency limits
- Implemented RLS policies for secure access control

### Chronicle System

- Created `session_logs` for complete session transcription with diarization
- Added `highlighted_actions` for key campaign moments and decisions
- Implemented `archived_sessions` for memory pruning of older sessions
- Added diarization support with speaker type, confidence scoring, and dialogue type classification

### Entity Locking

- Added locking fields to NPCs, locations, story arcs, and new entities (items, factions)
- Created the `lockable_fields` reference table to validate field names
- Implemented time-based locks with `unlock_at` timestamp
- Added a `revision_queue` for handling edits to locked fields

### Conflict Resolution

- Implemented the `conflict_resolution_queue` with priority levels and auto-resolution flags
- Added the `agent_activity_logs` for tracking and auditing agent changes
- Created entity versioning with `entity_versions` table for rollback support
- Implemented cross-campaign sharing with `shared_entities` table

## TypeScript Types and Services

### Voice Types and Service

- Defined interfaces for TTS requests, responses, and voice profiles
- Created resource queue system to limit concurrent TTS requests
- Implemented dialogue choice generation for NPC conversations
- Added caching mechanism to reduce redundant TTS generation

### Chronicle Types and Service

- Defined types for session logs, highlighted actions, and archived sessions
- Created transcript processing with diarization and entity extraction
- Implemented session memory pruning for archiving older sessions
- Added session summarization for recap generation

### Locking Types and Service

- Defined interfaces for entity and field locking
- Implemented permission checking for agent modifications
- Created revision queue system for handling locked field edits
- Added field-level locking controls

### Conflict Resolution Types and Service

- Defined types for conflict creation, resolution, and versioning
- Implemented activity logging for tracking all agent changes
- Created entity versioning system for rollback support
- Added cross-campaign entity sharing with configurable permissions

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Field-Level Entity Locking**: Granular control for DMs to lock specific aspects of their world
2. **Conflict Resolution System**: Structured approach for handling conflicting agent suggestions
3. **Memory Management**: Session pruning and archiving to balance between recent context and long-term memory
4. **Voice System**: Resource-controlled TTS with caching for NPC dialogue
5. **Entity Versioning**: Complete rollback support for any entity changes
6. **Cross-Campaign Sharing**: Global or targeted sharing of entities between campaigns

## Usage Flow Examples

### NPC Voice Generation

```typescript
// Generate speech for an NPC
const speechResult = await voiceService.generateSpeech(
  "npc-123",
  "Hello adventurers!",
  "campaign-456"
);

// Get dialogue choices
const dialogueOptions = await voiceService.generateDialogueChoices({
  npc_id: "npc-123",
  context: "The party has just entered the tavern",
  max_choices: 3,
});
```

### Session Chronicle

```typescript
// Process a transcribed segment
const processedTranscript = await chronicleService.processTranscript({
  raw_text: "DM: You see a dragon approaching. Player 1: I ready my bow.",
  session_id: "session-123",
  campaign_id: "campaign-456",
});

// Add a key moment to the session
await chronicleService.addHighlightedAction({
  session_id: "session-123",
  campaign_id: "campaign-456",
  title: "Dragon Encounter",
  description: "The party encountered a red dragon",
  importance: "high",
  category: "combat",
  entities_involved: ["dragon-123", "player-1"],
});
```

### Entity Locking

```typescript
// Check if an agent can modify an NPC
const canModify = await lockingService.canModifyEntity(
  "npc-123",
  "npc",
  "personality"
);

// Lock a specific field
await lockingService.lockField({
  entity_id: "npc-123",
  entity_type: "npc",
  field: "personality",
  locked: true,
  unlock_at: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // Unlock in 24 hours
});
```

### Conflict Resolution

```typescript
// Log an agent activity
await conflictService.logActivity({
  agent_name: "LoreAgent",
  entity_id: "location-123",
  entity_type: "location",
  field_modified: "description",
  old_value: { text: "A small village" },
  new_value: { text: "A small coastal village" },
  mode: "Planning",
  campaign_id: "campaign-456",
});

// Create a version for rollback
await conflictService.createVersion({
  entity_id: "npc-123",
  entity_type: "npc",
  data: {
    /* full NPC data */
  },
  created_by: "DMAssistant",
  campaign_id: "campaign-456",
});
```

## Next Steps

1. Implement user interface components for:

   - DM changelog panel for reviewing agent changes
   - Conflict resolution interface for choosing between agent suggestions
   - Voice profile editor for customizing NPC voices

2. Integrate with speech-to-text services for real-time Chronicle Agent input

3. Create the AI agent implementations for each specialist domain
